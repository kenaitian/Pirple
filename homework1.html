        <li>
            A very large stock pot (at least 10 quarts)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        PREPARATION
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour 1 cup vinegar into a large bowl. Swish beef shank and stew beef in vinegar to rinse. Transfer beef to a
            colander and rinse with water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir Epis Seasoning Base, lime juice, and seasoned salt in another large bowl. Add beef, toss to coat, and
            let marinate at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 5 cups broth in very large stock pot over medium. Add marinated beef and bones, cover, and simmer until
            meat is beginning to soften, about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add squash to pot on top of beef, cover, and return to a simmer. Cook until squash is fork-tender, 20–25
            minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer squash to a blender. Add 4 cups broth and purée until
            smooth. Return to pot and bring to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add potatoes, carrots, cabbage, onion, celery, leek, turnips, chile, rigatoni, cloves, garlic powder, onion
            powder, 2 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, a pinch of cayenne, parsley, if using, thyme, if using, and
            remaining 6 cups broth. Simmer, uncovered, until pasta and vegetables are tender, 30–35 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add oil, butter, and remaining 1 Tbsp. vinegar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beef is very
            tender, 15–20 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste and adjust seasonings. Divide soup among bowls and serve with bread alongside.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Do Ahead
    </h2>
    <p>
        Soup can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Cooks' Note
    </h3>
    <p>
        This soup feeds a large crowd. If you have a smaller crew or smaller pot, feel free to halve the ingredients.
        You might need to add extra liquid while cooking.
